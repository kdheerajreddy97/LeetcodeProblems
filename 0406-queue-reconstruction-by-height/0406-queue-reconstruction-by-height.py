# Greedy Approach: 1. Sort in descending order accorging to the heights; if there are of same height then sort with ki values - least first (asc)
# 2. Iterate again and insert them according ki value position 
# Basically I am keeping taller people at the front which means, once I sort it i can keep shorter people anywhere before

# Time: O(nlogn) + O(n2) = O(n2); Space: O(n)

        # O(n2)
